            <span> The Meaning of Karma </span>
            <p>
                The concept of Karma originates from the law of cause and
                effect, emphasizing that
                <strong>good deeds bring positive outcomes</strong>, while bad
                actions may lead to negative consequences. This idea first
                emerged in Indian philosophy, which holds that a person&apos;s
                behavior not only impacts the present but may also shape the
                future.
            </p>
            <p>
                In modern society, the term “karma” is widely used—not only as a
                symbol of the consequences of one&apos;s actions, but also as a way
                to measure user contributions and interactions on social
                platforms. Whether in philosophy, ethics, or everyday life,
                karma serves as a reminder:
                <strong
                    >every good deed you perform may influence the world—and may
                    also impact you.</strong
                >
            </p>
            <span> Karma Token — A Symbol of Good Deeds </span>
            <p>
                Karma Token is a non-financial digital asset designed to record
                and symbolize acts of kindness. It carries the belief that “good
                deeds deserve recognition.” We hope that every act of goodwill
                can be seen, and every kind-hearted individual can be
                encouraged—thus inspiring more people to engage in philanthropy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around the world, countless good deeds occur every day—from
                supporting vulnerable groups to promoting community
                development—yet these actions are often difficult to quantify
                and record. Karma introduces an innovative
                <strong>minting mechanism</strong> and a community reward
                system, making it a symbol of goodwill rather than a tradable
                instrument. This ensures that its philanthropic essence remains
                pure and aligned with the original meaning of “karma.”
            </p>
            <span> The Minting Mechanism of Karma Token </span>
            <p>
                Karma Token is a non-financial digital asset created to record
                acts of kindness. All Karma Tokens are minted directly from
                philanthropic actions, ensuring their alignment with the concept
                of “good deeds.” There is <strong>no pre-mining,</strong> nor
                does Karma support any form of paid minting. The only way to
                mint Karma is through charitable donations, establishing a
                decentralized and transparent system for recording acts of
                goodwill.
            </p>
            <span>Why Is Donation Chosen as the Minting Mechanism?</span>
            <p>
                Donations have been selected as the trigger for Karma&apos;s minting
                process based on the following reasons:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="strong pd-text">1. Clearly Defined: </span>Donation
                activities are typically explicit and verifiable, making them
                easy to track and record.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="strong pd-text">2. Quantifiable: </span> The
                donation amount serves as a measurable standard, ensuring a
                degree of fairness in the minting process.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="strong pd-text">3. Amplification Effect: </span
                >Charitable giving often attracts attention from media,
                communities, and the, helping to expand the impact of
                philanthropy.

            <span> The Global Landscape of Charitable Giving </span>
            <p>
                According to statistics from U.S. charitable donations in 2022,
                the total amount donated reached $499.3 billion. The
                distribution was as follows:
            </p>
            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong>• </strong> Religion: approximately <strong>28%</strong>

            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong>• </strong> International Affairs: approximately
                <strong>6%</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong>• </strong> Arts, Culture, and Humanities: approximately
                <strong>5%</strong>

            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, donations from the United States account for about
                <strong>40%</strong> to <strong>45%</strong> of global
                charitable contributions. Based on this, it is estimated that
                global charitable donations totaled around
                <strong>$1.2 trillion</strong> in 2022. Such a vast volume of
                philanthropic activity should not remain confined to traditional
                record-keeping methods. Instead, it should be permanently
                documented on the blockchain—making good deeds visible and
                philanthropy more transparent.
            </p>
            <span> Karma Minting Process</span>
            <p>
                To ensure that Karma is used solely to record genuine
                philanthropic donations, the team follows a transparent and
                impartial donation verification process:
            </p>
            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong>1. Authorization</strong>: The Karma team contacts the
                fundraising organizer or individual to obtain consent from the
                donor, recipient, and organizer, authorizing Karma to
                participate in the donation record.
            </p>
            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong>2. Donation Witnessing:</strong> When the donation
                occurs, the Karma team <strong>does not interfere</strong> with
                the original process. It simply acts as a witness, recording the
                donation amount based on the current strong value.
            </p>
            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong>3. Karma Minting:</strong> According to the roadmap and
                the donation amount, the Karma team mints the corresponding
                number of Karma Tokens and distributes them to the relevant
                parties (details provided in later sections).
            </p>
            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong>4. Philanthropy Promotion:</strong> After the
                fundraising organizer officially announces the donation, the
                Karma team shares the related information through
                channels to enhance awareness and amplify the impact of the
                charitable action.
            </p>
            <p>
                This mechanism ensures that Karma is not a token to be “bought”
                or “traded,” but rather a digital symbol used to record and
                represent good deeds. It reinforces the philanthropic nature of
                Karma and helps it avoid financial regulatory risks.
            </p>
            <span>Maximum Supply of Karma</span>
            <p>1,000,000,000 (One Billion)</p>
            <span>Karma Minting Calculation Method</span>
            <p>
                The minting of Karma is divided into 11 phases, with a total
                supply of 1 billion tokens. We have adopted a gently ascending
                exponential curve to represent the growth of an organization
                from its early stages to maturity. The curve begins slowly, as
                if a newborn entity is quietly taking root—like cells dividing
                in silence, or ideas gradually taking form, barely noticeable to
                the outside world. But over time, each effort begins to
                accumulate impact, gently accelerating the curve. Just like
                sunlight piercing through a forest, vines begin to climb, leaves
                gradually spread, and influence silently expands—from a spark
                into a wildfire.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mathematically, we use the exponential function y = e^x - 1 to
                model the natural growth of value, and define the horizontal
                position of each batch using a non-uniform segmentation method:
            </p>
            <p>x_i = L * (i / n)^0.83</p>
            <p>
                Here, L represents the total length, n is the number of batches,
                i is the index of the current batch, and the exponent 0.83
                controls the pacing of the batch intervals. This
                “wide-at-the-front, narrow-at the-end” segmentation approach
                softens the steep ascent of the exponential function in its
                later stages, resulting in a smoother and more orderly overall
                growth of the minting area. This design not only ensures that
                early batches have sufficient room and significance, but also
                aligns the entire system with the natural rhythm of real-world
                growth—progressing from accumulation, to amplification, to
                wide-scale diffusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                The deep red labels in the chart represent the number of Karma
                tokens minted in each batch, with the specific figures as
                follows:
            </p>
            <div className="karma-content_img">
                <img src={diagram} alt="" loading="lazy" />
            </div>
            <p>
                In addition, the donation amount required to mint one unit of
                Karma increases with each batch, mimicking the logic behind
                Bitcoin&apos;s increasing mining difficulty over time. As community
                consensus grows, the system rewards “early adopters” with
                greater returns, while setting higher entry thresholds for
                “later participants.” This pricing mechanism not only reinforces
                the value of time but also further enhances the sustainability
                and fairness of the ecosystem.

                <strong>Cross-Batch Calculation:</strong> In some cases, a
                single large donation may span multiple minting batches. When
                this happens, the Karma allocation is calculated based on the
                minting rules of each applicable batch to ensure fairness.

            <p><strong> Example:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Suppose the current minting is happening in Batch 5, where 1
                Karma = $1.28. If a donation is large enough to exceed the
                remaining minting capacity of Batch 5 and spills into Batch 6
                (where 1 Karma = $2.56), then:

            <span>Karma Allocation</span>
            <p>
                Karma is generated solely through the minting mechanism. Each
                minting event follows a fixed allocation ratio to ensure that
                Karma remains exclusively tied to philanthropic actions,
                avoiding unfair distribution due to secondary market operations
                or pre-mining strategies.

            <p>
                The core mission of the Karma Charity Fund is to promote acts of
                goodwill on a broader scale, using Karma as a philanthropic
                incentive tool. The fund operates with complete transparency—
                every movement and expenditure of funds is recorded on the
                blockchain, ensuring 100% traceability and enhancing
                trust.
            </p>
            <p><strong> Key Features of Fund Operations:</strong></p>
            <p>
                <span className="strong pd-text">• Full Transparency:</span> All
                fund transactions and flows are recorded on-chain and are
            ly accessible.

                <span className="strong pd-text">• Karma-Only Donations:</span> The
                fund only accepts donations in Karma. If non-Karma assets are

                deposited into the fund&apos;s account to maintain the asset&apos;s clear
                philanthropic positioning.

                    >• Decentralized Governance Model:</span
                >
                The fund is governed by aly elected committee. This
                committee submits charitable funding proposals weekly, with only
                one proposal allowed to be executed per round. Proposals that
                are not approved must be resubmitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Charity Guardian NFT</strong> serves as the core
                governance tool for the fund. It grants holders the right to
                vote on charitable funding proposals. Purchasing the NFT
                provides the holder with governance participation rights.
            </p>
            <p><strong> Governance Rules for Charity Guardian NFTs:</strong></p>
            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong><span>• </span>Weekly Voting on Proposals: </strong>Each
                week, the committee submits one or more charitable funding
                proposals, which are voted on by Charity Guardian NFT holders
                within a two-day window.
            </p>
            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong><span>• </span>One Vote Per NFT, Irrevocable: </strong
                >Each NFT can cast only one vote per proposal, and the vote
                cannot be changed once submitted.
            </p>
            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong><span>• </span>Validity Threshold: </strong>A proposal
                will only be executed if it receives the highest number of votes
                and the total votes in favor exceed one-third of the total
                number of NFT holders.
            </p>
            <p className="pd-text">
                <strong><span>• </span>Governance as a Good Deed: </strong
                >Actively participating in governance is regarded as an act of
                kindness. Participants may receive occasional Karma airdrops as
                a reward. However, there is no guaranteed frequency or amount,
                in order to prevent the NFTs from acquiring financial
                characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together, these rules ensure that the Charity Fund and the NFT
                governance mechanism are tightly integrated, clearly defining
                the charitable nature and governance function of the Charity
                Guardian NFTs while mitigating financial risk.

            <span>Conclusion</span>
            <p>
                Karma has built a decentralized philanthropic incentive
                ecosystem, anchored by an innovative minting mechanism that
                ensures all Karma tokens originate from real charitable
                donations— upholding the principles of transparency and fairness
                in philanthropy. The token&apos;s design deliberately avoids
                financial attributes, focusing instead on recording and
                encouraging acts of kindness.
            </p>
            <p>
                The integration of the Charity Fund with Charity Guardian NFTs
                brings transparency and democratization to fund governance. By
                purchasing NFTs, community members gain the right to vote on
                funding proposals, achieving a close alignment between community
                self-governance and the philanthropic mission.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, the launch of the Karma Wallet greatly enhances the
                ecosystem&apos;s practicality. It offers secure digital asset
                management, real-time communication, fiat conversion, and
                payment capabilities—significantly improving the interaction
                between donors and recipients, as well as the effectiveness of
                philanthropic funding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, Karma will continue to improve and expand the
                features of its philanthropic ecosystem, striving to build a
                global good network that is transparent, trustworthy, and
                efficient—where every good deed is clearly visible, and every
                reward is genuinely verifiable.
